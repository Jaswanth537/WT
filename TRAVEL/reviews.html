                <p>New Zealand is amazing country and 2 1/2 weeks wasn't nearly enough time.  We planned the trip because our daughter was studying abroad in Wellington for the semester.  Our travel planner tailored the trip to our specifications, quickly making any and all necessary changes.   Traveling from the South Island to the North, the itinerary was thorough and included maps, directions as well as additional activities to do in each location.  We arrived on the South Island, just after a heavy rain storm that closed Milford Sound.  This was to be our first excursion and we were a bit disappointed.  We contacted our travel planner and her team in New Zealand who were diligent in trying to rebook a modified version of the tour</p>

                <p>Our travel planner was so helpful in planning our family's trip to Belize for Spring Break 2020.  And perhaps even more helpful when we decided to cut our vacation short and return to the US as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.  Hopefully we will be able to finish our trip in the jungle someday!  Ambergris Caye was a beautiful place with a lot to do.  Our travel planner worked with us to set up the perfect combination of organized trips and the travelers choice days.  We enjoyed getting to know the locals and loved the vibe.  We definitely will be back and use this travel company when we do!</p>

                <p>I was very pleased with the service that I received from our travel company.  Our 12 day trip to Belize had to be cut short because of fears and closures as a result of Covid 19 but we were able to enjoy 9 wonderful days in this beautiful country.  The resorts that our travel planner chose for our stay were all wonderful!  She was in constant communication with us via email asking how the trip was going and if we had any concerns or requests and when I did have a request she responded immediately and took care of it.  Everything including tours and transportation were taken care of for us so it was very relaxing knowing we did not have to think about anything except when and where we were going next. </p>
