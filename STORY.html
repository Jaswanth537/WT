<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center">HAUNTED CHURCH</h1>
<p>Centuries ago, King Robert Cliveson promises to build a huge Church for a
Jesus idol, if the latter saves his kingdom from drought. It regains normalcy
after unexpected rains and King constructs a huge Church under the
supervision of Harold Moore. On the night of every Christmas, huge white
light is emitted the Church since its origin and people believed it as Jesus's
presence and blessings. Since then, Jesus was worshiped there on a grand
scale till 2012. However the Church was closed due to few circumstances in
2013 and whoever tried to reopen it or know about it died mostly because of
a snake bite or an accident making the Church a haunted place.

<p>An endowment officer Robert comes to know about the mystery and gets
killed by a snake bite. ACP Rex who is investigating the case takes
permission from endowment department chief Jonathan Drake for
completing the procedures. Later he receives a book which had Robert's
research on the Church's mystery. On a parallel note, Alex is a medico and
also a fearless atheist who is sent for a medical camp to Godstown where
this Church is situated. He considers a BDS final year student Sarah as his
lucky charm who also happens to be a native of this place. The Sheriff
Ronald provides the accommodation at The Basker Mansion to the medicos
group which is a very strange two floor building with a big statue of a five
headed snake on its top shut since 2013. One night Alex witnesses the death
of Rex in an accident and gets Robert's book there. He reads it and learns
about the Church's myth but nothing about the mystery is written</p>
  <br>
<p>Sarah's father Joseph is a religious person associated with the Church and he
refuses to share anything regarding the Church with Alex and also refuses
Alex's proposal to marry Sarah whom he loved. When Alex's family visits
him, Joseph accepts his proposal to marry Sarah and Alex sends his family
back next morning because of few haunting experiences last night. That day
Alex captures the snake which is trying to kill him. At the reptile department
in his college, his professor explains to him, Sarah and his friends that the
snake is hypnotized and its target is to kill Alex. He approaches Joseph and
asks him to reveal the truth. It is known that the Church was shut because of
untimely deaths in the Church because of a snake and will be closed
permanently if Jesus does not prove his presence by emitting the light on
Christmas next year according to the Town heads.</p> 
 <br>
<p>A Chief Priest at Baskerville explains the mystery behind that huge light to
Alex and Joseph. During its construction phase Cliveson wanted this Church
to have a unique feature as a gratitude to Jesus. Harold Moore then hides
Cliveson's precious and sacred Lapis-Lazuli stone at the idol's feet and
constructs the Church in such a way that moon rays on Christmas night
would fall on that stone which multiplies it by thousands of times thus
emitting a huge light which was believed as Jesus's blessings. Alex visits the
Church on Christmas night and there he finds that Jonathan is the culprit.
The light is emitted and the Church is reopened. Jonathan confesses that he
wanted to steal the stone and thus created a scenario of mysterious deaths by
hypnotizing a snake.</p>
<br>
<p>Alex is unhappy with Joseph crediting god for the Church's reopening as he
solved the mystery. Joseph then says that not all the happenings were merely
human acts or coincidences but also had god's interference which includes
Alex being rescued from the snake, Chief Priest speaking only with them
among all, the old mad saint allowing only Alex to enter the village initially
etc. Alex feels that his age is not enough to justify god's presence but for
every prayer, there is a power and an answer. He sees his full name
Alexander Jesus on his certificate at convocation, implying that he was
Jesus's pawn in reopening the Church and saving the stone.</p>
