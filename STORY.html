<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center">HAUNTED CHURCH</h1>
<p>                                 Centuries ago, King Robert Cliveson promises to build a huge Church for a
Jesus idol, if the latter saves his kingdom from drought. It regains normalcy
after unexpected rains and King constructs a huge Church under the
supervision of Harold Moore. On the night of every Christmas, huge white
light is emitted the Church since its origin and people believed it as Jesus's
presence and blessings. Since then, Jesus was worshiped there on a grand
scale till 2012. However the Church was closed due to few circumstances in
2013 and whoever tried to reopen it or know about it died mostly because of
a snake bite or an accident making the Church a haunted place.</p>
